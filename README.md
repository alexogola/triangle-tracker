# TRIANGLE-TRACKER

 This project is a web page displaying a triangle tracker.

## Author name

Alex Ogola

## Project description

A web page that allows the user to input the lengths of the sides of a triangle, and returns whether these sides form an equilateral, isosceles, or scalene triangle or if the sides cannot make a triangle at all.

## Technology used

This web page was built using hyper text markup language ,cascading styles sheet and JavaScript.

Target Audience-Everyone.


## Project setup installation

1.On GitHub, navigate to the main page of the repository.

2.Under the repository name, click Clone or download.

3.In the Clone with HTTPs section, click  to copy the clone URL for the repository.

4.Open Terminal.

5.Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory to be made.

6.Type git clone, and then paste the URL you copied in Step 2.

7.Press Enter. Your local clone will be created.

## Behaviour driven development
* The program should return this when the input is not a number:

**Input Example**: a

**Output Example**: Please enter valid dimensions.

* The program should return this when the input is a negative value:

**Input Example**: -1

**Output Example**: Please enter valid dimensions.

* The program should return this when the sum of any two sides is less than or equal to the third side:

**Input Example**: Length of side A = 1, Length of side B = 1, Length of side C

**Output Example**: These measurements cannot form a triangle.

* The program should return this when all sides are equal:

**Input Example**: Length of side A = 4, Length of side B = 4, Length of side C = 4

**Output Example**: These measurements form an equilateral triangle.

* The program should return this when at most two sides are equal:

**Input Example**: Length of side A = 4, Length of side B = 4, Length of side C = 5

**Output Example**: These measurements form an isosceles Triangle.

* The program should return this when all sides are not equal:

**Input Example**: Length of side A = 4, Length of side B = 5, Length of side C = 6

**Output Example**: These measurements form a scalene Triangle.
